<h2>Here's a timeline of Kennedy's life: </h2>



<ul>
  <li><strong>Early life</strong> John Fitzgerald Kennedy was born on May 29, 1917,
    at 83 Beals Street in the Boston suburb of Brookline, Massachusetts, to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.,
    a businessman and politician, and Rose Kennedy, a philanthropist and socialite.
    His paternal grandfather, P. J. Kennedy, was a Massachusetts state senator. Kennedy's maternal
    grandfather and namesake, John F. Fitzgerald, served as a U.S. Congressman and was elected to
    two terms as Mayor of Boston. All four of his grandparents were children of Irish immigrants.
    Kennedy had an elder brother, Joseph Jr., and seven younger siblings: Rosemary, Kathleen ("Kick"),
    Eunice, Patricia, Robert ("Bobby"), Jean, and Edward ("Ted"). </li>

  <li><strong>Education</strong> Kennedy attended the Canterbury parochial school (1930 &#8211 31) and the
    Choate School (1931 &#8211 35). One of his teachers later said that people in school liked him more for
    his personality than for his accomplishments. He was often ill during his childhood and spent much
    of this time reading. Kennedy enrolled at Princeton University in 1935 but illness soon forced him
    to withdraw. Upon recovery he went to Harvard University, where he majored in government and
    international relations. During his junior year at Harvard, he traveled in Europe and observed
    the events that were leading to World War II (1939 to 45 ; a war in which the Allies&#8211France, Great
    Britain, the Soviet Union, China, and from 1941 the United States&#8211fought against the Axis
    powersâ€”Germany, Italy, and Japan). He used his observations for his senior paper, which later
    became the bestselling book Why England Slept (1940).

    After graduating from Harvard with honors in 1940, Kennedy went to Stanford University for
    graduate studies. In April 1941 he tried to enlist in the U.S. Army but was rejected for
    physical reasons (a back injury received while playing football). Months later, after his
    back strengthened through a regimen of exercises, the U.S. Navy accepted him. He then became
    an intelligence officer in Washington, D.C. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, a U.S.
    Navy base in Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, the United States entered World War II. Kennedy
    requested active duty at sea and was given this assignment in late 1942. </li>

  <li><strong>Impact</strong> Kennedy once summed up his time as "very dangerous, untidy." He
    lived through two world wars, the Great Depression (a period from 1929 to 1939 during which
    nearly half the industrial workers in the country lost their jobs), and the nuclear age.
    "Life is unfair," he remarked. And so it was to Kennedy, heaping him with both glory and
    tragedy. Yet, he never lost his grace, his sense of balance, or his optimism.

    What Kennedy accomplished was not as important as what he stood for. As the African magazine
     Transition expressed it, "murdered with Kennedy was the first real chance for an intelligent
     and new leadership in the world. His death [left] us unprepared and in darkness. </li>

<blockquote>
<q>We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard,
because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that
we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.</q>

&#8212 John F. Kennedy
